## RULES OF BLACKJACK

## Main Objective
* The main goal of Blackjack is for the player to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21

## Card Values
* A standard 52 card deck will be used
* All numbered cards hold a value of that number
* Face cards hold a value of 10 
* Aces can be either 11 or 1, depending on if the Ace will cause the player to bust or not.
    --For example: If the player has a hand of 15, chooses to hit, and receives an Ace, the value will be 1 instead of 11,
      as an 11 would cause a bust.

## Gameplay
* The game begins with the player being dealt 2 cards face up, while the dealer gets 1 card face up and 1 card face down, called the "hole card"
* If the player has a natural 21, (An ace with either a 10 or face card) this is called Blackjack and the player automatically wins, unless
  the dealer also has Blackjack, in which case the round ends in a draw
* If the player does not have Blackjack, they have the option to "hit" (receive another card)
* The player may hit as many times as they want until they reach 21. If a player's card total exceeds 21, they automatically lose. This is called a "bust"
* Once the player decides they have received enough cards, or simply does not wish to risk a bust, they will "stay"
* When they player decides to stay, the turn then moves to the dealer, who then flips over the hole card
* If the dealer has Blackjack, they automatically win unless the palyer also has Blackjack
* The dealer must continue to hit if their score is 16 or less
* Once the dealer reaches a score of 17 or more, they will stay
* If the dealer exceeds 21 on a hit, they bust and automatically lose the round
* If the score is the same, the round will end in a draw
* Whoever has the higher score without exceeding 21 at this point wins the round
